# Saad Qureshi | Developer Portfolio

This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website.
It presents my work as a Full Stack Web Developer and Game Developer, including shipped products, production-style projects, and published games.

The portfolio itself is intentionally lightweight and handcrafted, while the showcased projects demonstrate modern frameworks, backend services, and game engines used in real-world development.
